        <p>Every night, every hour on the hour, the Eiffel Tower lights up full of golden lights that sparkle for five whole minutes while a beam illuminates the city. It takes 40km of illuminating garlands and approximately 20,000 led bulbs to make this landmark glow. That's a lot of lights! The best place to see the show is from Place du Trocadéro.</p>
